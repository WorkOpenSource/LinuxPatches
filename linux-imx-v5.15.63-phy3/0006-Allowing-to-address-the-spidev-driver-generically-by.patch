Subject: [PATCH 06/15] Allowing to address the spidev driver generically by
 the devicetree

With this patch we can link the device in the devicetree by the compatible
string 'spidev' - otherwise we would have to link it by a spi-controller
which is not built in our device.

Since we already use the 'spidev' in our devicetree, we have to find a way
to keep it working - best without any misleading warnings. Thus we decided
to remove the 'buggy DT: spidev listed directly in DT' from the code.
